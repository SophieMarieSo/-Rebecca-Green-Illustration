        "In January, my friend Katie and I signed up for a 6 week clay class. I‚Äôd been wanting to sign up but always put it off until alas the class was sold out. This time we jumped on it because this winter was awful. Not cold. But dark. New Years was the worst, shuffling into 2024 without our girl, and my January birthday‚Ä¶that was a hard day too. I found out I was pregnant on my 37th birthday last year and this year I felt a decade older in a postpartum body and without a baby. Needless to say I had to get out of the house during those bleak evenings. ",

I‚Äôve had a bit of experience with ceramics in the past and knew I‚Äôd love it but oh. I. Am. Smitten. It‚Äôs such a joy to be working with my hands but in a different capacity. And there are rules. I like the rules. With painting there are rules but I don‚Äôt know, trying to break them all the time is exhausting and as a 2-d artist, you have to set many of the limits yourself.",

        "The first couple of things I made on the wheel fell apart but something clicked on the fourth or fifth go. The teacher was great - he taught me to keep my hands steady and s l o w. If I moved them too fast from fright or overconfidence, the whole thing became wobbly. I started to feel more comfortable with the clay - and I realized just as in painting or drawing, we each find our own way to use materials. Nice to have instruction but also be intuitive with how our own process develops.",

        "I‚Äôm definitely humbled by the process and of course have so much more respect for people who work with clay. But I‚Äôm in the beginner‚Äôs sweet spot where there isn‚Äôt pressure to make anything amazing, and mastering this process feels a long way off. Of course my mind jumps to‚Ä¶I‚Äôll make this, and then I can do that, and then I‚Äôll sell them and have lovely ceramic drops, and maybe wholesale, and on and on. So many ideas! But it feels nice to go slow too, to take my time learning, understanding the rules of the clay, of the glazes. So much of it feels like it‚Äôs in other people‚Äôs hands too - I know nothing about firing and that‚Äôs such a big part of it. For now, I‚Äôm reveling in the beginner-ness of it all.",

It‚Äôs probably not shocking that my translation is just animals wearing pom pom shoes and candle holders. My heart wants what it wants. I have ten thousand ideas of how to bring it all to life but again, there‚Äôs a part of the process that demands patience.",

I know what that‚Äôs like‚Ä¶things we love can be here one second and then poof, the next, they‚Äôre gone.

        "Another thing I love is interacting with other people in the class. We don‚Äôt get into deep conversations but just the small talk and chit chat around ceramics is lovely. Most days I only talk to Mori or Matt, and if I‚Äôm lucky, drinks or dinner with a friend. The people I meet through working out and the clay class are meaningful to me because they remind me I‚Äôm part of a community. Living in a rural area with no other illustrators is so hard but these little interactions get me through for now.  (In regards to the benefit of these outer social rings, I loved this hidden brain podcast on the benefits of tiny interactions)",

Turns out, the underglazes mixed well and it‚Äôs so cute! Below is a (glazed but unfired) bat candle holder I made in honor of Sohvi since her birthday was in October. The holder part is a flurry of oak leaves. I plan to put a little match in the bat wings but idk‚Ä¶I might make it again. We‚Äôll see how the glaze works out! Just behind it you can see my thin walled bowl! The teacher was proud. So cute. :)",

        "Even though starting something new can be intimidating, I find that it‚Äôs usually when the stakes are high that it feels stressful.  Maybe it‚Äôs a final illustration or a first page in a sketchbook. I shared some thoughts on it in The Dessert Club last week - just how beginning is always terrifying. But there is another sort of ‚Äòbeginner mode‚Äô that‚Äôs brilliantly freeing. When there isn‚Äôt an expectation for everything to be incredible at once, you can cozy up to the learning and give it room to breathe. The possibilities in this new venture, for me, are endless so long as the process cooperates. And if it doesn‚Äôt and everything blows up in the kiln, I had fun and I did get some small talk out of it. üíõ",
