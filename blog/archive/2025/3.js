A new adventure awaits. I’ve scooped up an adorable studio in a warehouse full of artists (thanks to my pal Ginnie Hsu) and I’m eager to explore the hiking trails and eat all the food! Also it sort of blows my mind that I’ll be able to shop for art supplies at an actual store where I can feel the paper and see the colors in person. Dreams do come true!",

I’ve finished picture book work in the middle of an empty room, a cardboard box for a studio table. A Little Princess was painted in a car garage, Loujain Dreams of Sunflowers at a dining room table. Really, where ever there was a flat surface and adequate light, I made it work. But now I’m getting old and wise (and tired!) and I’d rather let this move be a little more chill.",

While I’m still working on my book series, sharing regularly on Patreon, and leading an Art Retreat in Spain this Summer, I’m going to ease up on writing a monthly long form post here on the blog. For the last four years, I’ve been writing posts on everything from the creative cycle, to building a portfolio, to my love of line. It’s strengthened my writing skills and helped me articulate ideas on the creative process. Mostly though, it’s been an incredible way to share and connect with you. Moving forward, I’ll be sharing quarterly blog posts, in line with the seasons. I’ll still be sending monthly newsletter bulletins with thoughts, updates, and inspirations.",

Thanks to everyone who has reached out to tell me they wait for the first of every month so they can read the blog. To everyone who so caringly wrote to me - some of you even sending packages and postcards to my postal box - kind words for the loss of our Sohvi. This community means so much to me. Even though I shared my online social struggles in the last post, the connections made here and on IG (and everywhere online) are real and valuable and treasured.",
