        "This week I bought a tin of pumpkin tea and a cider scented candle, both of which I thought would make Autumn proud. She's at our doorstep, hiding red bouquets in the trees like easter eggs, blowing cold air into dewy mornings, and filling the hills with dense fog. Year after year around this time, a youthful, almost annoying glee sparks deep within me. It's this time of year that my innermost 'me' comes to life, crawling out from the proverbial summer grave. This year feels a little different though. For the first time in my life, I am quite bitter about her arrival. Autumn - October in particular - my favorite month, means one whole year without our daughter Sohvi. ",

        "I haven’t shared our loss in depth, but if you've been a reader for some time, you'll know that we lost our daughter shortly after birth on October 16th of last year. Everything up until that moment was perfect - every ultrasound and heartbeat test. I saw her full round cheeks squished up on the screen mere days before she was born. I had little Halloween outfits for her, autumnal quilts, plans for her future October birthdays…the list is long. But life is wild and it doesn't always do what it we want it to, as hard as the heart tries to make it so.",

        "Since last Autumn, it hasn't been easy to fold this grief - this life alteration, into my public work. But I am an artist and writer. I filter my experiences into tangible things to share and connect (and how lucky I am to do this.) I’m truthfully still digesting everything before I can fully share our story. In my studio, work has been a respite. I have poured my heart into my book series and taught a retreat that I knew would bring me joy. ",

        "Now that Autumn is nearing however, it’s testing my creative resolve. A time which usually carries so much inspiration now feels heavy with loss and mocking. What helps of course is to accept the sadness, which in all truthfulness, I'm happy to wear. It makes me feel close to my daughter, myself, to my husband, and to everything that unfolded. I'm not afraid of grief, nor was I at any point comforted by the sentiment that grief would ease up. Every emotion does. What has surprised me though about leaning into Fall is how much resistance I feel towards it. But tragedy knows no season and I can love the little treasures of this time of year, bittersweet as they might be.",

        "If you make art, you know you must sometimes seek inspiration, for it does not always chase you down. I was determined to find a spark of creative joy towards this season, for my own sake, for art’s sake, for Sohvi’s - and after a few false starts, I did just that in the form of little painted treasures. What makes Autumn so particularly lovely is how short it is, how a flash of red is here and then gone before the long winter settles in. Witnessing the end of a life too, gives us this lightness - a reminder that it is all over, especially for some, too quickly. Nick Cave speaks of this so poetically after losing not one, but two sons.",

        '"This feeling… of alertness to the inner-spirit of things — this humming — comes from a hard-earned understanding of the impermanence of things and, indeed, our own impermanence. This lesson ultimately animates and illuminates our lives. We become witnesses to the thrilling emergency of the present — a series of exquisite and burning moments, each extinguished as the next arises. These magical moments are the bright jewels of loss to which we cling". - Nick Cave',
