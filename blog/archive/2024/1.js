More detail means a slower pace of storytelling and also less efficiency for me in getting it all done. But the books are still incredibly detailed - I’m just focusing my energy on world building in the right spots. Here are a couple peeks from the sketch phase of the books…(omg I can’t wait for these to come out and for you to see them - literally YEARS in the making!)",

I had the immense joy of attending Milkwood last Summer and we got to see the originals for Farmhouse and my mind was blown! So many insanely intricate details. (She even lifted the covers off the characters in bed and underneath they were illustrated with full pajamas and toes!) She’s illustrated over 50 book, won a multitude of awards (including two Caldecotts!) and still has the capacity to seemingly put care into everything she puts out into the world. (For a treat, watch some BTS from Farmhouse!)",
