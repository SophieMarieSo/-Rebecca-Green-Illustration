        "On the very morning I am writing this and sending it into the world, I awoke to snow. Every branch and blade of grass coated with a thick white blanket. It doesn’t matter how many winters I’ve seen - there is always magic in that first big snow. I am a four season person through and through having lived most of my life in Michigan. The seasons guide the flow of my life and my work. While we’ve lived in warm, places  - Phoenix, Tennessee, Japan, I always knew we’d settle somewhere with a proper winter. It seems we have. Apparently this area gets three different types of snow storms - nor'easters, lake effect storms and Alberta clippers, which is <em>a lot of snow.</em> This year I plan to get out, try my legs once more at cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and hiking, but I also plan to spend a lot of time <em>nestling in.</em>",

        "We don’t technically have the best place to nestle - a quarter of our home is still gutted and everything we own is still in boxes. Perhaps though, because I’m seeking comfort so badly, the tiny areas of it are easy for me to sink into. Our bed, with it’s rug ‘neath it and the duvet on it, a little bench beside it crowded with books. That’s enough. The candle lit when the sun goes down, a definite source of comfort. Our little makeshift coffee station in our hallway. That helps. And a shower, a hot shower. That’s all you need!",

        "And nestling in, wintering, hibernating, is not only about physical comforts, but emotional and creative ones too. I recently read Katherine May’s book, Wintering, which was recommended to me many times. It’s a lovely book, which does traces the darker seasons of the calendar, but is more so an understanding of retreat in those darker times of life, when you must recoup, rest, and heal. One thing that resonated was her recounting of the pattern of wintering, how she could feel it coming on, and rather than blasting through the signs of weariness into total burnout, she could then and there decide to nurture herself <em>through it.</em>",

        "I am usually pretty good about taking care of myself and my mental health through shifting workloads, and only once have experienced an internal crisis after of powering through pain. My Aunt, whom I love very much (and the only extended family I’ve ever been close with) died from cancer in 2017 and instead of stopping to grieve, I worked harder. It was a tough lesson, lots of therapy, lots of reconstructing. And now, I can see myself again trying that very tactic to somehow deny a very big and painful loss. I did take time to grieve last fall when we lost our little one and have done many things to aid in healing since. But it was also a major year for work, moving, selling a house, buying one too, and trying to settle into a normal routine.",

        "I’ve been feeling my own signs of wintering for a while, or rather, I don’t feel them which is concerning because I’m a big feeler. Things that used to fill me with tenderness, rage, utter joy, seem to have a dullness to them. The sharpness of it all is gone. Creatively, this is terrifying if I’m honest. The deepest source, where all my work sprang from…it’s there but also hard to access. I also am struggling with the energy to give and giving is a big part of who I am. Most of my adult life I’ve had the heart of a host, and second best, a gracious guest. Now, I feel more like a witness who does not want to host a party or go to one, but instead to stand outside the window and just…witness. All of this for me is a clue that I need to take care of myself.",

Some are gems everyone loves and some are my closet loves that make me feel old and nerdy, and some are weird and you might hate them, but whatever. Let the nestling begin!",
